# MICB_305
For MICB 305 Project


## Oct 30

Feedback on Proposal

## Nov 5

Updated bash commands all the way to PICRUSt2

## Nov 6 - meeting

Discussion of Alpha Beta Diversity Analysis

Have plots ready by the week of Nov 24

To-do before next meeting
- Mixing the data to explore some potential significant diversity differences
  -- Include all substrate location, kept the four orders
  -- Include all substrata location, keep all the orders
  -- Group non-perciformes orders together and compare with perciformes
  
## Nov10

Created datasets_and_results folder, added all .qzv and datasets files from the server(/work/project_2). 
## Nov 12 - meeting
1. Discussion of the results of the indicator species, core microbiome analysis, and differential abundance analysis.
2. Discussion of the results from the three analysis whether it is applicable to an random forest analysis.
3. Discussion of the feedback of the proposal and potential revision.

To do before next meeting:
- Run the functional group analysis and differetial abundnace pairwisely
- Make presentation to display the results of alpha diversity, indicator taxons, Differential Abundance, Core microbiome, and functional group analysis
- Revision of the proposal


# Problems: the feature-table.txt is too large to be uploaded
## Nov 20 - meeting
- Presentation and Discussion of results from core microbiome analysis, indicator species analysis, alpha diversity analysis, and DESeq analysis

To do before next meeting:
- Keep p-value
- No taxonomical differences but functional differences
- Send whole datasets before breaking up to Arvil for running PICRUST2
- Fix the graph for present-ready
- Redo alpha diversity in R for present-ready

## Nov 27 - meeting
- discussion for the presentation
- suggestions for the presentation
- final results discussion

## Nov 28 - notes
- emphasize why we study (why are we interested) in the findings
- title for each slide should be a main takeaway
- for manuscript figures and table:
  - fig 1: alpha and beta diversity
  - fig 2: core microbiome
  - fig 3: PICRUST with three sub panels (abc)
  - table 1: indicator taxa
- future direction: whether fish diet correlates with functional analysis
##### Check whether manuscript need to uploaded onto Github
##### Check whether the "rocky reef" habitat indicate rocky reef habitats in a specific region
## Dec 4 - meeting
- Discussion for Manuscript
- Discussion of "DISCUSSIONS" section in Manuscript
- Discussion about the ANCOM-BC Analysis
- Discussion about future directions
### Limitation
- small sample
- large gap between different fish orders sample counts
- choices of rarefaction depth could be biased
- No seasonal diety data for fish order

### meeting notes
- Look at other articles on the UJEMI for presenting results in the manuscript
- Focus on the discussion section 
- Result title should a one informative, takeaway sentence (similar to the slides)
- Table: statistic of each indicator taxa
- Mention p-values in the figures/description of figures; don't mention them in the text; don't repeate information
- In the method section, remember to site the papers of tools and packages used
- Justify why we want a larger sample size in limitation (Perciformes has ~70% of total sample numbers)
_ Highlight research gap and link to reason why we study
- Background information (whats known, whats not known); don't explicitly mention hypothesis
- Aim is for proposal, it's not necessary for the manuscript; it's irrelevant
- Remove Random Forest content in the introduction
- Manuscript is more like a flow of a story
- Formatting: Figures should be at the end of the document; supplemental as separate files
